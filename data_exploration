Temporal Analysis:

Use line charts or time series plots to visualize the frequency of DDoS attacks over time.


Attack Distribution:

Create bar charts or pie charts to represent the distribution of different types of DDoS attacks.


Source and Destination IP Analysis:

Use network diagrams or heatmaps to visualize the relationships between source and destination IP addresses involved in attacks.
Plot the top attacking and targeted IP addresses.
Protocol Analysis:


Packet Metrics:

Histograms or box plots can be used to visualize the distribution of packet metrics such as packet size, frequency, or duration.
Time series plots for specific packet metrics can provide insights into attack patterns.
